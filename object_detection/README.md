# Object detection
Use Yolo3 Darknet pretrained model
Visualize Yolo3 output (https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/)

Need to download:
- coco.names (download from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/tree/master/data)
- yolo3.cfg (download from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/tree/master/cfg)
- yolo3 pretrained model (237 mb) (https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
